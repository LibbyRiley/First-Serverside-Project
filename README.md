<h2>TYPE CIRCUS TYPESETTING CHALLENGE WEBSITE.</h2>
<h4>WEBSITE & CMS - SCHOOL PROJECT</h4>
<p>This was my first serverside website build, completed during my Diploma of Web Development</p>
<p>The concept for Type Circus was inspired by Typophile forum challenges which happen regularly and produce some awesome type design and typeset work.</p>
<p>My project was much bigger and more complicated than the course brief required for the timeframe so I had to work hard to finish it all, but I learnt a lot during the project.</p>
